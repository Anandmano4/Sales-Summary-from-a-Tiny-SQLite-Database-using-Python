# Sales-Summary-from-a-Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python
# Sales Data Analysis with SQLite and Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to analyze sales data using SQLite and Python. It queries a sales database to calculate the total quantity sold and total revenue for each product, then visualizes the results with a bar chart.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (with Pandas and Matplotlib)
- **SQLite** (for storing and querying sales data)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib

   2. Run the script:

python sales_analysis.py


3. The script will:

Create a SQLite database and insert sample sales data.

Query the database for total quantity and revenue per product.

Display the results in a bar chart.




Output

The sales summary is printed in the console.

A bar chart (sales_dual_chart.png) showing revenue and quantity per product is generated.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization using SQLite and Python. It can be expanded for more complex datasets and analyses.
